          The ozone hole is an area in the stratosphere where the ozone layer is
          significantly depleted, primarily over Antarctica, though it also
          occurs over the Arctic and in other areas. Ozone in the stratosphere
          serves as a shield, protecting life on Earth from harmful ultraviolet
          (UV) radiation, which can lead to health issues such as skin cancer
          and eye damage. The ozone hole was caused by the release of substances
          like chlorofluorocarbons (CFCs), which break down ozone molecules.
          Although international agreements such as the 1987 Montreal Protocol
          have significantly reduced CFC emissions, the recovery of the ozone
          layer is slow and may take several decades.
