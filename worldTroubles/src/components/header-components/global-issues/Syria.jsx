        <p>
          The Syrian Civil War, which began in 2011, has resulted in one of the
          most devastating and prolonged conflicts of the 21st century.
          Initially sparked by pro-democracy protests against President Bashar
          al-Assad's authoritarian regime, the violence quickly escalated into a
          full-blown civil war. The conflict involves multiple factions,
          including the Syrian government, opposition groups, Kurdish forces,
          and extremist organizations like ISIS. International powers, such as
          Russia and Iran, have supported Assad, while the U.S. and Turkey have
          backed various opposition groups, further complicating the situation.
          The war has caused massive loss of life, with hundreds of thousands of
          deaths and millions of people displaced, both internally and as
          refugees abroad. The conflict has also devastated the country's
          infrastructure, economy, and social fabric. Attempts at peace talks
          have largely failed, and the war continues to have severe humanitarian
          consequences, with many parts of the country still under siege or
          affected by sporadic violence. Syrian Civil War remains a complex and
          deeply entrenched conflict, involving a combination of local,
          regional, and global interests.
