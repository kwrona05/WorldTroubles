          Poverty is a complex and widespread issue affecting billions of people
          globally, especially in developing nations. It is often characterized
          by a lack of access to essential resources, such as food, clean water,
          education, and healthcare, limiting individuals' ability to meet basic
          needs and improve their circumstances. Key causes include economic
          inequality, unemployment, lack of educational opportunities, and
          political instability. Additionally, poverty perpetuates a cycle where
          limited access to resources hinders personal and community
          development, keeping people in conditions of deprivation. Poverty also
          exacerbates other social problems, such as malnutrition, poor health,
          and low life expectancy, as those in poverty are often unable to
          afford medical care or nutritious food. Efforts to reduce poverty
          involve a combination of providing immediate aid and addressing
          systemic issues, like improving access to education, promoting job
          creation, and ensuring fair economic policies. Ending poverty requires
          collaborative global and local efforts to tackle these root causes and
          support sustainable development.
