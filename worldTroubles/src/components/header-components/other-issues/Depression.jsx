          Depression is a serious mental health condition marked by persistent
          feelings of sadness, hopelessness, and a lack of interest or pleasure
          in daily activities. It can impact one's thoughts, behavior, and
          physical health, often causing symptoms like fatigue, changes in sleep
          and appetite, difficulty concentrating, and even physical pain.
          Depression varies in severity, ranging from mild to severe, and can be
          episodic or chronic. Its causes are complex, involving a combination
          of genetic, biological, environmental, and psychological factors. Life
          events, trauma, stress, and even certain health conditions can
          increase the risk of developing depression. Treatment generally
          includes a combination of therapies, such as psychotherapy,
          medication, and lifestyle changes, and for some people, specialized
          therapies like cognitive-behavioral therapy (CBT) or support groups
          can be effective. Depression is common worldwide, and raising
          awareness and understanding is key to reducing its stigma and ensuring
          access to mental health care.
