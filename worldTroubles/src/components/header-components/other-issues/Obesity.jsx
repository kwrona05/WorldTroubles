          Obesity is a complex health condition characterized by an excess of
          body fat, often measured using the body mass index (BMI), where a BMI
          of 30 or higher typically indicates obesity. It results from a
          combination of factors, including genetics, lifestyle, environment,
          and certain health conditions. High-calorie diets, physical
          inactivity, and metabolic factors also contribute to obesity. This
          condition increases the risk of severe health issues like heart
          disease, type 2 diabetes, certain cancers, and mental health
          challenges such as depression and anxiety. Addressing obesity requires
          a holistic approach that includes healthy dietary habits, regular
          exercise, behavioral therapy, and sometimes medical or surgical
          interventions. Given the high prevalence worldwide, obesity is also
          recognized as a global public health issue, impacting healthcare
          systems and economies significantly.
